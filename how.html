    <h2>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎What was the development process like?</h2>
    <div class="how">
    <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎First of all, becuase this web application is technically "full-stack", that is it has a functional database that the back-end interacts with, after the front end is manipulated by a user, we needed a special IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) to write the code. Essentially, we needed a server that could simulate how the code would all run and interact together once the app was fully up and running. So, we chose Visual Studio Code, because of the ease of implimentation of any add-ons to the enviroment that would help us in the development of our project. VS Code has an integrated terminal which is great because, it allows a user to run shell commands, without having to keep switching to the seperate command line app. That made installing Node.js (which we needed for the server side JavaScript) and all it's other dependancies for the project an absolute breeze.<br /><br /> ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎Once we were all set up and running in the IDE, now was time to take the whiteboarded concepts and expand upon them, to really instill in ourselves what we were trying to accomplish, and what our goals are. We expanded upon the RESTful Routes that would be needed to accomplish the CRUD functionality that we desired. For example, according to RESTful Routing requirements for the main Index page, we decided our main "feed" page be referred to as the "/blogs" path. And another example, the Edit Route would be called by the "/blogs/:id/edit" path, and once that Route was called, it would show the edit option for that specific blog post, or "tweet". If you want to see all of the remaining Routes, or learn more about these concepts and how they interact with the database, check out the <a href="https://github.com/nick-ball/group-project">Github Repo</a>.<br /><br />
     ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎After getting the Routes out of the way, the rest of the backend code was implimenting the dependancies that were needed, such as the database which is MongoDB. There are essentially "Models" that have to be created and defined that tell the database system what information to store, what type it is, and where to store it. For example, in the new post "Model", the Title and Content of the post are of course made up of 'String' input. From there, it gets extremely complicated, so I will just keep it somewhat simple with the database and backend interaction. As far as remaining NPM or Node dependancies go, there were a few remaining ones we needed to impliment. A couple examples are the middleware package known as bodyParser, and also EJS which is a simple version of JavaScript as a templating language that lets a user generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript as well as, in our use case, embed server side JavaScript code in the templates and routes that the user would see and interact with. There were a set number of 'show' templates, or what the browser will present to the user, written in good old HTML, CSS and a front end library for CSS known as Semantic UI, which we used as an alternative to the well known Bootstrap library, mainly its use was for ease of styling and responsiveness.</p>
