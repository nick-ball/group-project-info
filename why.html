    <h2>Why We Made This Project</h2>
    <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎Essentailly everyone knows that a properly structured group project can reinforce skills that are relevant to both group and individual work, such as the ability to break complex tasks into easier to solve parts and steps, planing and time management skills, and they can help to refine understanding through group discussion and debate. But many people do not realize that it is always worth it to take that step and go that extra mile to link up with people you normally never would never. There are too many reasons to list but here are a few of the benefits that really motivated us to make this project and work together as a group: 
    <ul>
        <li>We gave and received extremely valuable feedback on our performance</li>
        <li>We fostered and developed much stronger communication skills</li> 
        <li>We are now all ready to tackle complex problems on our own that we never could have before</li>
        <li>In a group setting, we are all comfortable delegating roles and responsibilities for everyone</li>
        <li>We are all comfortable sharing diverse perspectives on topics, to pool our knowledge as a group</li>
        <li>We have all now been held accountable by the other group members for set deadlines</li>
        <li>Arguably the most valuable, we established a sense of shared identity with the other group members</li>
    </ul>
     ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎While we knew going in to this project that the potential learning benefits of group work would be significant, and not just for the employers, we never knew that it could be such a useful and beneficial venture in so many other aspects of our daily lives. After the great success that this project was and continues to be, it is a certain possibility that we will team up again in the future to create something amazing again.</p>
