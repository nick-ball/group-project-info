    <p>‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎We all know that Twitter is one of the best social media platforms currently available for us to use. Users are able to follow other people, make new postings to the site in the form of "tweets", as well as "re-tweet" or repost another users posts. It is a very widely used platform with almost everyone you can think of having a personal account nowadays.<br /><br />
    ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎When myself and four others who are also participants in the Apprenticeship opportunity program at CSCC grouped up with the purpose of creating something we would be proud to show off to an interviewer, we brainstormed together for days. We wanted something that would not take many weeks to months in the conceptual stages, because the sooner our group project came to fruition, the better. After all, the main point of us grouping up was not to ship a good-looking project, realistically our purpose was, and still is, to show prospective companies that we can work as a team to create.<br /><br />
    ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎We knew we wanted a web-app that has CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Destroy) functionality, and has a persitent database where the server can be shut down, and when it is powered back on, any posts in the feed are still present, in order. After extensive research, we realized that a full-blown Twitter clone with user authentication and authorization and profiles and unique feeds would be far too time consuming, and unnecessary for what we are trying to accomplish. Plus, Twitter as we know it does not let a user Update or Edit a post once it is made. So, we decided on a blog style app that is responsive, and could be mistaken as a simple, restyled Twitter clone at a glance. And that is how the Twitter Clone Application was born.<br /><br />
